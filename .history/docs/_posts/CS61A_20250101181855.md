### Lecture

#### Welcome

The first lecture just a simple explaination of CS61A and explnation of the `Expression Tree` which is composed of a operator and several operands, so I just paste the picture of the Tree.

> Easy but interesting.  
> If you learned data structure, you may think this is `n-ary tree`.

#### Functions

##### name

###### built-in

Like c/c++, python also has its own way to name or rename a parameter, a function or a variable and so on. The lecture will introduce it at beginning.  

`Ctrl + L` is used to flash the terminal in python session.  

```
>>> pi  
Traceback (most recent call last):  
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
NameError: name 'pi' is not defined  
```

oops! No pi! This means the parameter is not a built-in parameter. We have to `import` it.  

```
>>> from math import pi  
>>> pi  
3.141592653589793  
```

The same goes for imported functions.

```  
>>> from math import sin  
>>> sin(pi)  
1.2246467991473532e-16  
>>> sin(pi/2)  
1.0  
```

> You may find it not zero after sin(pi), because of the type of data storage in the computer or just a data cut. Not important.

###### name by ourselves

We can also name our own parameter:  

```
>>> radius = 10
>>> radius
10
```

Even multiple variables named simultaneously is also supported:

```
>>> area, circ = pi * radius *radius, 2 * pi * radius
>>> area
314.1592653589793
>>> circ
62.83185307179586
```

The same goes for imported functions.  

###### define

We can edit our functions by `def`:  

```
>>> def square(x):
...     return mul(x, x)
... 
>>> square(11)
121
```

If we change the value of parameter, the value of expression named by us will not change, but if define a functions will solve the issue:  

```
>>> def area():
...     return pi * radius * radius
... 
>>> area()
314.1592653589793
>>> radius = 20
>>> area()
1256.6370614359173
```

> A function differs from a name in that its return expression here gets re-evaluated every time it's called.

#### defining functions

structure of defining:  

```
>>> def <name>(<formal parameters>)
    return <return expression>
```

> Fuctions will be evaluated when it is called.

The lecture also introduce the difference between local frames and global frames. I passed it for my c&c++ basics.  

#### Environment Diagrams

#### Print and None

Just talk about the difference of print and evaluate and `Nonetype`.

```
>>> None
>>> print(None)
None
```

### Lab

#### Lab0:Getting Started

> Download starter files from: `https://cs61a.org/lab/lab00/lab00.zip`  

##### Introduction

This lab explains how to setup your computer to complete assignments and introduces some of the basics of Python.  

Components cheek passed, so skip them.  

##### Setup

skip.  

##### First Assignment

###### What Would Python Do?

Enter the following in your terminal to begin this section:  

``` bash
# we don't have edu email of berkeley, so we need to add --local
python ok -u --local
```

Esay to pass:  

```bash
=====================================================================
Assignment: Lab 0
OK, version v1.18.1
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Python Basics > Suite 1 > Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

What would Python display? If you get stuck, try it out in the Python
interpreter!

>>> x = 20
>>> x + 2
? 22
-- OK! --

>>> x
? 20
-- OK! --

>>> y = 5
>>> y = y + 3
>>> y * 2
? 16
-- OK! --

>>> y + x
? 28
-- OK! --

---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

###### Implementing Functions

lazy to think:  

```python
def twenty_twenty_four():
    """Come up with the most creative expression that evaluates to 2024
    using only numbers and the +, *, and - operators.

    >>> twenty_twenty_four()
    2024
    """
    return 2024 * 1 + 1 - 1
```

###### Running Tests

use `ok` to check:  

```bash
python ok --local
```

check passed:  

``` bash
=====================================================================
Assignment: Lab 0
OK, version v1.18.1
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running tests

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Test summary
    2 test cases passed! No cases failed.
```
